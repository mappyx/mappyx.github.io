# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello and welcome! I'm **Rafael Paez**, a passionate web developer with a focus on creating robust, scalable applications.

## About This Blog

This blog is built using a custom markdown-based system that allows me to write posts in simple markdown format. Each post is stored as a `.md` file and rendered dynamically using JavaScript.

### Features

Here are some of the features of this blog system:

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with language support
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Terminal-inspired design using pip-ui framework

## Technical Stack

This portfolio is built with:

* Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Pip-UI framework for styling
* Custom markdown parser
* GitHub Pages for hosting

### Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What to Expect

In future posts, I'll be sharing:

1. **Technical tutorials** on web development
2. **Project showcases** from my GitHub
3. **Thoughts on technology** and best practices
4. **Tips and tricks** I've learned along the way
